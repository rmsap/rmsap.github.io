                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            <p>
                                Image Processor is a stand-alone Java application that can load in ppm, jpg, png, and bmp images,
                                manipulate them (e.g. greyscale an image or blur an image), and save them. It has both a graphical
                                user interface and a text-based user interface. The GUI displays a frequency histogram of values
                                for red, green, blue, and intensity (average of the red, green, and blue values of a pixel). Image
                                Processor was developed for an assignment in Northeastern CS 3500, Object-Oriented Design.

                            <h3>Development Process</h3>
                            <p>
                                From start to finish, Image Processor was developed with object-oriented design principles in mind.
                                It initially only supported the text-based view and a limited number of operations on images (for 
                                example, blur and sharpen were not initially supported), but my partner and I knew that the program
                                would eventually expand beyond that. So, we used the model-view-controller pattern to make it easier
                                to later develop additional features (like the GUI). Additionally, we employed the command design
                                pattern to implement image operations so that more could be added later without changing any 
                                previously written code. We also employed the command design pattern to implement loading and 
                                saving different image formats because only ppm files were supported at first.
                                <br />
                                In the next iteration of the project, new operations (sharpen, blur, greyscale, and sepia) were 
                                added, as was support for additional image formats (jpg, png, and bmp). Throughout this process,
                                operations were abstracted when possible, such as sharpen and blur being in the same class
                                and just employing a different filtration matrix.
                                <br />
                                In the final version of ImageProcessor, the GUI was created, which involved creating a new view 
                                and controller. Both views implement a single view interface and both controllers implement a single
                                controller interface so that they can be used interchangeably, however. Also, the downscale operation
                                was implemented at this point.
                                <br />
                                Throughout each phase of development, each method was throuougly tested using JUnit to ensure that
                                no bugs were present in any feature of the Image Processor.

                            <p>
                                Image Processor is programmed entirely in Java with its GUI programmed in Java Swing.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Installation</h3>
                            <p>
                                1. Clone the repository on GitHub (linked above).
                                <br />
                                2. To run the GUI: run the JAR file in res.
                                <br />
                                To run the GUI from the terminal: cd into the res folder and then type the command 
                                <code>java -jar ImageProcessor.jar</code>.
                                <br />
                                To run the text-based interface: cd into res and then type the command <code>java -jar
                                ImageProcessor.jar -text</code>. For how to use this interface, see the USEME.txt file in the root
                                directory of the project.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                            <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                                Image Processor is completely self-contained; it doesn't need to access any external databases
                                or programs in order to function.
