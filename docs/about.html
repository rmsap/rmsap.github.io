                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I started programming when I was in eighth grade on my middle school's robotics team, I and continued to
                    program throughout high school on my school's FIRST Robotics Competition team. However, I quickly became
                    interested in programming applications outside of robotics, so I joined my school's Code Club and was able to
                    work on many different projects, from creating snowflakes out of LED lights that turned on an off to designing
                    mobile apps. After graduating high school, I started studying computer science at Northeastern University,
                    where I learned principles of object oriented and functional program design.

                    <br />
                    I am most proficient in Java and Python, but also have experience in C, C++, Racket, and JavaScript. I have
                    experience with GitHub, Docker, and Linux (mainly Ubuntu). I've both worked in and led teams of programmers on
                    a range of projects, from programming robots to creating mobile apps.

                    <h3 style="text-align: center">About Me</h3>
                    Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and watching TV/movies. My favorite books are <i>Frankenstein</i>
                    by Mary Shelley and <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien, and my favorite movie is <i>Interstellar</i>. 
                    I also like to play wiffle ball and go rock climbing with my friends. My favorite genre of music is rock,
                    and my favorite bands are Metallica, ACDC, and Weezer.
