                    Originally from central New Jersey, I'm now a second year computer science student at Northeastern University.
                    In class, I've learned principles of both object-oriented and functional programming design. I am 
                    most proficient in Java and Python, but also have experience in C, C++, Racket, and JavaScript. 
                    I've both worked in and led teams of programmers on a range of projects, from programming robots to creating 
                    mobile apps.

                    I started programming when I was in eighth grade and continued to program throughout high school on my
                    school's FIRST Robotics Competition team. However, I quickly became interested in programming applications
                    outside of robotics, so I joined my school's Code Club and became Co-President in tenth grade. Through many
                    different projects, I became the programmer that I am today.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and playing video games. My favorite books are <i>Frankenstein</i>
                    by Mary Shelley and <i>We</i> by Yevgeny Zamyatin. I also like to read other sci-fi and fantasy books.
                    I also like to play wiffle ball and go rock climbing with my friends.
