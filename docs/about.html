                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        I started programming when I was in eighth grade on my middle school's robotics team, and I continued to
                        program throughout high school on my school's FIRST Robotics Competition team. However, I quickly became
                        interested in programming applications outside of robotics, so I joined his school's Code Club and was able to
                        work on many different projects, from creating snowflakes out of LED lights that turned on an off to designing
                        mobile apps. After graduating high school, I started studying computer science at Northeastern University,
                        where he learned principles of object oriented and functional program design.

                        <h3 style="text-align: center">About Me</h3>
                        Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and watching TV/movies. My favorite books are <i>Frankenstein</i>
                        by Mary Shelley and <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien, and my favorite movie is <i>Interstellar</i>. 
                        I also likes to play wiffle ball and go rock climbing with my friends. My favorite genre of music is rock,
                        and my favorite bands are Metallica, ACDC, and Weezer.
