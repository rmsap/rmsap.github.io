                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Ryan started programming when he was in eighth grade on his middle school's robotics team, and he continued to
                        program throughout high school on his school's FIRST Robotics Competition team. However, he quickly became
                        interested in programming applications outside of robotics, so he joined his school's Code Club and was able to
                        work on many different projects, from creating snowflakes out of LED lights that turned on an off to designing
                        mobile apps. After graduating high school, he started studying computer science at Northeastern University,
                        where he learned principles of object oriented and functional program design.
